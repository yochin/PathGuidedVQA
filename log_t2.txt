Answer the questions.
A chat between a human and an AI that understands visuals. In images, [x, y] denotes points: top-left [0.0, 0.0], bottom-right [1.0, 1.0]. Increasing x moves right; y moves down. Decreasing x moves left; y moves up. Bounding box: [x1, y1, x2, y2]. Image size: 1.0x1.0. The input image depicts the view from a pedestrian's position, taken at a point 80cm above the ground for pedestrian navigation purposes.In this image, the user's starting point is situated at the bottom-center point [0.5, 1.0] of the image. Consider the starting point as the ground where the user is standing. Don't talk about detailed image coordinates. Consider perspective view of the 2D image property.

@run_llava16_model_cli - automatic user input: The image contains obstacles, tree_trunk [0.6, 0.0, 0.61, 0.17], tree_trunk [0.75, 0.06, 0.76, 0.18], bollard [0.67, 0.59, 0.75, 0.78], tree_trunk [0.67, 0.03, 0.68, 0.17], tree_trunk [0.77, 0.04, 0.79, 0.16], pole [0.92, 0, 0.96, 0.33], tree_trunk [0.58, 0.05, 0.59, 0.17].
 First, describe the overall photo from near to far. Second, explain the path to the destination, point [0.69, 0.27], paying attention to obstacles along the path in 1 line. Third, choose GO or STOP with the reason in 1 line.
